MyIdeas
A developer and former entrepreneur with a strong foundation in **Organizational Management** (Polytechnic University of Chernihiv) and **Accounting** (Institute of Economics and Management). 

My professional journey transitioned from years as an accountant and running my own business to specializing in technology. 

Currently, I focus on building robust **Python software** and **AI-powered web applications**, with a specialization in creating high-impact **automation projects for the Print-on-Demand (POD) industry**. I leverage my business acumen to develop technical solutions that are efficient, scalable, and profit-driven.
